/*  timer.c
 *
 *  This file manages the benchmark timer used by the RTEMS Timing Test Suite.
 *  Each measured time period is demarcated by calls to Timer_initialize() and
 *  Read_timer().  Read_timer() usually returns the number of microseconds
 *  since Timer_initialize() exitted.
 *
 *  These functions are prototyped in rtems/c/src/lib/include/timerdrv.h and
 *  must be implemented as part of the BSP.
 *
 *  This port does not allow the application to select which timer on the
 *  MVME167 to use for the timer, nor does it allow the application to
 *  configure the timer. The timer uses the VMEchip2 Tick Timer #1. This timer
 *  is distinct from the clock, which uses Tick Timer #2 in the VMEchip2.
 *
